# Get GitHub Blog entries

## Introduction

## Inputs

- `dry-run` - If `true`, the RSS feed will only be reported in the console log. If `false`, an issue will be created to list all RSS feed entries found.
- `labels` - A multi-line list of labels to search for. E.g. including `actions` will trigger the following search; `https://github.blog/feed/?s=actions`
- `days` - Number of days worth of posts to be included in the list
